 #  üåçPortfolio Projects

 ## 1. Unicorn Company: Data Exploration & Insights(SQL +Tableau+ Google Sheets)
 #### Goal: 
This project aims to provide data analysis insights for Unicorn, with the goal of significantly driving growth and development, as well as enhancing customer satisfaction
 #### Descriptions:
 The projects involved exploring Unicorn Company's sales, profit and customer data using SQL queries and transforming the insights into an actionable Tableau dashboard. We focused on identifying high-performing regions, products, and customer segments.
 #### Part I: Data Exploration with SQL
 1. Explore the Unicorn data using SQL to answer critical questions about scales, profits and customer types.
 2. Cleaned and joined tables, performed aggregations, ranked cities, products and regions by their performance.
 #### Part II: Analysis with Google Sheets
 Used pivot tables, created calculated columns(e.g.price per unit), and highlighted underperforming regions using conditional formatting.
 #### Part III: Insight & Dashboard  with Tableau
  Created a Tableau dashboard to present key insights, trends and actionable recommendations for bussiness-decision making.
 #### Key Insights
  1. Identified the most profitable cities, customer types, and products across different regions.
  2. Highlighted potential areas for bussiness growth in East and South regions.
  3. Recommended to refine discount strategies and increase the customer numbers in home office segment as well as improve the   delivery efficiency.
 #### Skills: 
 SQL: Data quering, joins, Data Manupulation/Data Query Language opeartions, subquery
 Data cleaning and filtering
 Tableau: Data visualization and dashboard building
 Business insights and recommendation
 #### technology: PostgresSQL, Tableau

## 2.Car Data Analysis(Python)
 #### Goal: 
 This project involves data cleaning, transforming and analyzing a dataset of car specifications and pricing to uncover market trends and relationships.
 #### Description:
 This project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis of a car dataset, which included details such as car models, engine specifications, fuel types, and prices.
 #### Key tasks:
  1.Cleaned and handled missing data, standardized text formats and filtered cars from 1995 and later.
  2.Created new features, such as Total MPG and Price per Horsepower for deeer analysing.
  3.Conducted exploratory data analysis(EDA) to visualize key trends in car pricing, horsepower, and market size.
  #### Skills:
  1.Data cleaning and transformation(Pandas, Numpy)
  2.Exploratory analysis and descriptive statistics
  3.Correlation analysis
  4. Data visualization(Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  #### Technology:Python(Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  #### Key Insights:
  1. Show strong relationshoip between engine HP and price.
  2. Show the relationship between the driven wheels and price.
  3. Highlighted effiency trends across different transmission types.

  ## 3.Vehicle Prediction Project (Python, Machine Learning)
  #### Goal:
   The project is to predict the class of vehicles (bus, van, and car) based on 18 numerical variable features.
  #### Description:
  This project involved data split, data cleaning (missing data, encoding and standarization), data exploratory, model fitting, and model evaluation of a cardataset.
  #### key tasks:

  2.Clean data (missing data handling) and standardize the numerical variables and encode the categorical variables
  3.Data Exploratory
  4.Fit Models (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest)
  5.Model Evaluation( accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC curve)
  #### Skills:
  1.Data split(sklearn)
  
  2.Data Clean and Exploratory(numpy, pandas, and seaborn) and visualiztaion (matplotlib)
  
  3.Standardization the numeric variables (sklearn.preprocessing)
  
  4.Get modeling(sklearn)
  
  5.Model Evaluation(sklearn.metrics)
  #### Technology: Phthon (Sklearn, numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib)
  ### Key Insights:
  1. Performance overviews: All parameters are above 90%, showing strong model performance overall.Random Forest and KNN exhibit the best values for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  2. ROC Analysis:Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest achieve the highest ROC value (0.996), showcasing their exceptional capability to distinguish between positive and negative samples.
  3. Random Forest Details:The training accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for the Random Forest model are all 1.0 and parameters of test data are greater than 0.953.
  4. Recommendations:
     (1) For high accuracy and stability: KNN or Random Forest are the most suitable choices.
     (2) For critical focus on ROC value (discrimination ability): SVM or Random Forest are recommended.
     (3) For simplicity and interpretability: Logistic Regression remains a practical option.
